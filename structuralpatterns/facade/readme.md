### **Structural Design Patterns: Facade Pattern**

#### **Objective**
The **Facade Design Pattern** simplifies interaction with a complex subsystem by providing a unified and simplified interface. It allows clients to interact with a system without dealing with the underlying complexities, promoting subsystem independence and portability.

---

### **What is the Facade Pattern?**

The **Facade Pattern** is a structural design pattern that provides a simplified interface to a complex system of classes, libraries, or subsystems. It decouples clients from intricate subsystem implementations, improving code maintainability and usability.

---

### **Real-World Analogy**
**House Facade**:  
- From the outside, you interact with a house via its main entrance (the facade).  
- Internally, the house has plumbing, electrical wiring, and HVAC systems. The facade simplifies the interaction by hiding these complexities.

---

### **When to Use Facade Pattern**

1. **Simplified Subsystem Interaction**:  
   - When a subsystem is complex and clients need an easy-to-use interface.  

2. **Decouple Clients from Subsystems**:  
   - When subsystems are tightly coupled, the facade provides a single entry point, reducing dependencies.  

3. **Portability and Independence**:  
   - Promotes independence and makes subsystems easier to replace or evolve.

### **Implementation**

#### **Use Case**:  
A **Home Theater System** has multiple components (DVD Player, Projector, Sound System, Lights). The Facade Pattern provides a unified interface to control the system.

---

#### **1. Subsystem Components**
Define the individual components of the system:

**DVD Player**:
```java
public class DVDPlayer {
    public void turnOn() {
        System.out.println("DVD Player is turned on.");
    }

    public void playMovie(String movie) {
        System.out.println("Playing movie: " + movie);
    }

    public void turnOff() {
        System.out.println("DVD Player is turned off.");
    }
}
```

**Projector**:
```java
public class Projector {
    public void turnOn() {
        System.out.println("Projector is turned on.");
    }

    public void setInput(String input) {
        System.out.println("Projector input set to: " + input);
    }

    public void turnOff() {
        System.out.println("Projector is turned off.");
    }
}
```

**Sound System**:
```java
public class SoundSystem {
    public void turnOn() {
        System.out.println("Sound System is turned on.");
    }

    public void setVolume(int level) {
        System.out.println("Sound System volume set to: " + level);
    }

    public void turnOff() {
        System.out.println("Sound System is turned off.");
    }
}
```

**Lights**:
```java
public class Lights {
    public void dim(int level) {
        System.out.println("Lights dimmed to: " + level + "%.");
    }

    public void turnOn() {
        System.out.println("Lights are turned on.");
    }
}
```

---

#### **2. Facade Class**
Create a `HomeTheaterFacade` class that encapsulates the subsystems:

```java
/**
 * Facade class to simplify interaction with the Home Theater System.
 */
public class HomeTheaterFacade {
    private final DVDPlayer dvdPlayer;
    private final Projector projector;
    private final SoundSystem soundSystem;
    private final Lights lights;

    public HomeTheaterFacade(DVDPlayer dvdPlayer, Projector projector, SoundSystem soundSystem, Lights lights) {
        this.dvdPlayer = dvdPlayer;
        this.projector = projector;
        this.soundSystem = soundSystem;
        this.lights = lights;
    }

    public void startMovie(String movie) {
        System.out.println("\nSetting up the home theater system...");
        lights.dim(10);
        projector.turnOn();
        projector.setInput("DVD Player");
        soundSystem.turnOn();
        soundSystem.setVolume(20);
        dvdPlayer.turnOn();
        dvdPlayer.playMovie(movie);
        System.out.println("Enjoy the movie!");
    }

    public void endMovie() {
        System.out.println("\nShutting down the home theater system...");
        dvdPlayer.turnOff();
        projector.turnOff();
        soundSystem.turnOff();
        lights.turnOn();
        System.out.println("Goodbye!");
    }
}
```

---

#### **3. Client**
The client interacts only with the `HomeTheaterFacade`:

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create subsystem components
        DVDPlayer dvdPlayer = new DVDPlayer();
        Projector projector = new Projector();
        SoundSystem soundSystem = new SoundSystem();
        Lights lights = new Lights();

        // Create the facade
        HomeTheaterFacade homeTheater = new HomeTheaterFacade(dvdPlayer, projector, soundSystem, lights);

        // Use the facade to start and end a movie
        homeTheater.startMovie("Inception");
        homeTheater.endMovie();
    }
}
```

---

### **Output**

```plaintext
Setting up the home theater system...
Lights dimmed to: 10%.
Projector is turned on.
Projector input set to: DVD Player.
Sound System is turned on.
Sound System volume set to: 20.
DVD Player is turned on.
Playing movie: Inception.
Enjoy the movie!

Shutting down the home theater system...
DVD Player is turned off.
Projector is turned off.
Sound System is turned off.
Lights are turned on.
Goodbye!
```

### **Benefits of Facade Pattern**

1. **Simplified Subsystem Access**:  
   - Provides an easy-to-use interface for complex subsystems.

2. **Reduces Dependencies**:  
   - Decouples clients from intricate subsystem details.

3. **Improved Maintainability**:  
   - Changes to the subsystem donâ€™t impact the client, as they interact only with the facade.

4. **Promotes Modularity**:  
   - Subsystems can evolve independently, simplifying upgrades or replacements.

---

### **Challenges**

1. **Over-Simplification**:  
   - The facade may hide important functionality, limiting flexibility for advanced users.

2. **Dependency on Facade**:  
   - Over-reliance on the facade can obscure subsystem details, making debugging harder.

---

### **When to Use Facade Pattern**

1. **Simplify Complex Systems**:  
   - When dealing with large subsystems that are difficult for clients to manage.

2. **Subsystem Independence**:  
   - To reduce coupling between subsystems and clients or other subsystems.

3. **Single Entry Point**:  
   - When subsystems require a unified interface for easier interaction.

---

### **Real-World Examples**

1. **Database Access Layers**:  
   - A facade simplifies interaction with database subsystems by encapsulating complex queries and connections.

2. **API Gateways**:  
   - Unified interfaces for interacting with microservices.

3. **E-commerce Checkout**:  
   - Facade manages payment processing, inventory updates, and order confirmation.

---

### **Key Takeaways**

- The **Facade Pattern** simplifies the interaction with complex subsystems by providing a single entry point.
- It decouples clients from subsystem details, improving code maintainability and modularity.
- While powerful, the pattern should be used carefully to avoid hiding critical functionality.
