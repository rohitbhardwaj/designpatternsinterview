### **Structural Design Patterns: Composite Pattern**

#### **Objective**
The **Composite Design Pattern** simplifies the representation of **part-whole hierarchies** by treating individual objects (leaves) and groups of objects (composites) uniformly. This pattern is especially useful for scenarios involving tree-like structures, enabling dynamic composition and consistent client interaction with both individual and composite objects.

---

### **Key Components**

1. **Component**:  
   - Declares the common interface for both individual objects and composite objects.  
   - Provides default behavior and defines methods for managing child components (add, remove, etc.).

2. **Leaf**:  
   - Represents primitive objects in the composition that do not have child components.  
   - Implements the operations declared in the `Component` interface.

3. **Composite**:  
   - Represents groups of `Component` objects.  
   - Implements child-related operations like adding, removing, and accessing child components.  
   - Often delegates operations to its child components.

4. **Client**:  
   - Interacts with `Component` objects without differentiating between leaves and composites.

---

### **Why Use the Composite Pattern?**

1. **Uniformity**:  
   - Treats individual and composite objects uniformly through a common interface.

2. **Hierarchical Structures**:  
   - Ideal for representing tree-like structures (e.g., file systems, organizational hierarchies).

3. **Flexibility and Scalability**:  
   - Simplifies the addition/removal of elements in the hierarchy without modifying client code.

4. **Client Simplification**:  
   - Clients interact with components without needing to know whether they’re dealing with a leaf or a composite.

### **Implementation**

#### **Use Case**:  
A **File System** represents files and directories. Files are leaves, and directories are composites containing other files or directories.

---

#### **1. Component Interface**

Define a common interface for both files and directories:

```java
/**
 * Component interface for files and directories.
 */
public interface FileSystemComponent {
    void showDetails(); // Display details of the component
}
```

---

#### **2. Leaf**

Implement the `FileSystemComponent` interface for files:

```java
/**
 * Leaf representing a file in the file system.
 */
public class File implements FileSystemComponent {
    private final String name;

    public File(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    @Override
    public void showDetails() {
        System.out.println("File: " + name);
    }
}
```

---

#### **3. Composite**

Implement the `FileSystemComponent` interface for directories:

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

/**
 * Composite representing a directory in the file system.
 */
public class Directory implements FileSystemComponent {
    private final String name;
    private final List<FileSystemComponent> components = new ArrayList<>();

    public Directory(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    public void addComponent(FileSystemComponent component) {
        components.add(component);
    }

    public void removeComponent(FileSystemComponent component) {
        components.remove(component);
    }

    @Override
    public void showDetails() {
        System.out.println("Directory: " + name);
        for (FileSystemComponent component : components) {
            component.showDetails(); // Delegate to child components
        }
    }
}
```

---

#### **4. Client**

The client interacts with the `FileSystemComponent` interface and can handle both files and directories uniformly:

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create leaf components (files)
        FileSystemComponent file1 = new File("Document1.txt");
        FileSystemComponent file2 = new File("Document2.txt");
        FileSystemComponent file3 = new File("Picture1.jpg");

        // Create composite components (directories)
        Directory documents = new Directory("Documents");
        Directory pictures = new Directory("Pictures");
        Directory root = new Directory("Root");

        // Build the tree structure
        documents.addComponent(file1);
        documents.addComponent(file2);
        pictures.addComponent(file3);
        root.addComponent(documents);
        root.addComponent(pictures);

        // Display details of the entire file system
        root.showDetails();
    }
}
```

---

### **Output**

```plaintext
Directory: Root
Directory: Documents
File: Document1.txt
File: Document2.txt
Directory: Pictures
File: Picture1.jpg
```

---

### **Benefits of Composite Pattern**

1. **Uniform Interface**:  
   - Simplifies client code by treating leaves and composites uniformly.

2. **Dynamic Composition**:  
   - Easily add, remove, or modify components in the hierarchy without changing client code.

3. **Flexibility and Scalability**:  
   - Scales well for complex tree-like structures.

4. **Simplified Client Interaction**:  
   - Clients don’t need to differentiate between individual and composite objects.

---

### **Challenges**

1. **Over-Generalization**:  
   - Makes it harder to enforce constraints on the composition (e.g., specific types of components in a directory).

2. **Complexity**:  
   - Introduces additional complexity for simple object hierarchies.

3. **Runtime Checks**:  
   - May require runtime checks to ensure proper composition behavior when constraints are needed.

---

### **When to Use Composite Pattern**

1. **Tree-Like Structures**:  
   - Ideal for file systems, organizational charts, GUIs, etc.

2. **Uniform Client Interaction**:  
   - When the client needs to treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.

3. **Dynamic Hierarchies**:  
   - When the structure of the hierarchy can change dynamically.

---

### **When Not to Use Composite Pattern**

1. **Simple Structures**:  
   - Avoid for non-hierarchical or simple hierarchies as it adds unnecessary complexity.

2. **Specific Component Constraints**:  
   - When the hierarchy needs strict constraints (e.g., a directory can only contain files, not other directories).

---

### **Key Takeaways**

- The **Composite Pattern** is ideal for tree-like structures where individual objects and composites need to be treated uniformly.
- It simplifies client interaction, promotes scalability, and makes hierarchical structures easier to manage.
- While powerful, it can over-generalize and introduce runtime complexity, so it should be used judiciously for appropriate scenarios.
