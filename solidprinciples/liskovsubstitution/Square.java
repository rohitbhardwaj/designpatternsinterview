/*
 * Behavioral Change:

Square changes the behavior of setWidth and setHeight in Rectangle.
When setWidth or setHeight is called on a Square, it modifies both dimensions to ensure it remains a square, which violates the expected behavior of a rectangle.
Substitutability Issue:

If a Square object is used in place of a Rectangle, the behavior is inconsistent with the base classâ€™s contract.
