# SOLID Principles for AI-Generated Code  
*5-hour hands-on workshop (intermediate → advanced)*  

Bridge the gap between AI-assisted code and production-ready, enterprise-grade solutions.

---

## Why attend?

AI tools can produce remarkable output—but also hallucinations, security holes, and brittle, non-SOLID designs.  
In this fast-paced workshop you’ll learn **how to critique, refactor, and harden AI-generated Java code** so it meets the bar for real-world deploys and technical interviews.

---

## What you’ll learn

| Theme | Practical outcomes |
|-------|--------------------|
| **SOLID diagnostics** | Spot and explain code smells in AI snippets; guide large-language-model prompts toward cleaner designs. |
| **Design-pattern mastery** | Apply creational, structural, and behavioral patterns to refactor brittle code into robust architectures. |
| **AI-specific pitfalls** | Neutralise hallucinated APIs, insecure defaults, prompt-injection vectors, and unscalable designs. |
| **Refactoring workflow** | Turn “good-enough” AI output into maintainable, testable, interview-ready code—step by step. |

---

## Is this workshop for you?

- You already code in Java and know the basics of SOLID and OO design.  
- You use (or plan to use) AI pair-programming tools at work.  
- You want to strengthen your architecture skills for high-stakes code reviews and interviews.

---

## Prerequisites

1. **Java IDE** – IntelliJ, Eclipse, or VS Code  
2. **Git clone** – grab the starter repo: `git clone https://github.com/your-org/ai-generated-code-workshop.git`  
3. Basic comfort with Java streams, generics, and unit tests

## Recommended next steps

- _Head First Design Patterns (2nd ed.)_—refresher on classic patterns
- Practice kata: refactor ChatGPT snippets using today’s checklist
