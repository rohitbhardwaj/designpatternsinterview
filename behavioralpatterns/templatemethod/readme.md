Behavioral Design Patterns: Template Method Pattern
Objective
The Template Method Design Pattern defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a superclass while allowing subclasses to customize specific steps. It enables code reuse and enforces a consistent algorithm structure, making it easier to manage and extend.

What is the Template Method Pattern?
The Template Method Pattern provides a predefined structure for an algorithm, encapsulating common steps in a base class. Subclasses can override specific steps to provide custom behavior without altering the overall algorithm.

Key Components
Abstract Class (or Interface):

Defines the overall structure of the algorithm through a template method.
Contains both concrete methods (common steps) and abstract methods (customizable steps).
Template Method:

A method in the abstract class that defines the sequence of steps in the algorithm.
Usually declared as final to prevent overriding and maintain structure integrity.
Abstract (or Hook) Methods:

Declared in the abstract class for steps that require customization.
Subclasses must override these methods to implement specific behavior.
Concrete Subclasses:

Extend the abstract class and provide implementations for the abstract methods.
Customize specific steps of the algorithm while adhering to its overall structure.
When to Use the Template Method Pattern
Common Algorithm with Variations:

When you have a common algorithm with steps that vary across use cases.
Code Reusability:

To reuse the overall structure of an algorithm while allowing flexibility for specific steps.
Enforcing Structure:

To maintain a consistent flow across implementations, ensuring that critical steps are not skipped.
Reducing Duplication:

To centralize common behavior in a single place, minimizing duplication in subclasses.
When Not to Use the Template Method Pattern
Highly Variable Algorithms:

If algorithms have little in common, the pattern may introduce unnecessary abstraction.
Tight Coupling Between Steps:

If steps are interdependent and frequently change, the pattern may lead to maintenance challenges.
Inflexibility at Runtime:

The predefined structure of the pattern may not support frequent or dynamic changes in the algorithm.
Implementation
Use Case:
A report generation system where different types of reports (e.g., PDF, CSV) share a common generation process but differ in formatting and content specifics.

1. Abstract Class
Define the structure of the report generation process:

java
Copy code
/**
 * Abstract class defining the template for generating reports.
 */
public abstract class ReportGenerator {
    // Template method defining the algorithm structure
    public final void generateReport() {
        fetchData();
        processData();
        formatReport();
        saveReport();
    }

    // Steps to be implemented by subclasses
    protected abstract void fetchData();
    protected abstract void processData();
    protected abstract void formatReport();

    // Common step implemented in the abstract class
    protected void saveReport() {
        System.out.println("Saving the report to disk.");
    }
}
2. Concrete Subclasses
Implement specific steps for PDF and CSV report generation:

PDF Report:

java
Copy code
/**
 * Concrete class for generating PDF reports.
 */
public class PDFReportGenerator extends ReportGenerator {
    @Override
    protected void fetchData() {
        System.out.println("Fetching data for PDF report...");
    }

    @Override
    protected void processData() {
        System.out.println("Processing data for PDF report...");
    }

    @Override
    protected void formatReport() {
        System.out.println("Formatting report as a PDF document.");
    }
}
CSV Report:

java
Copy code
/**
 * Concrete class for generating CSV reports.
 */
public class CSVReportGenerator extends ReportGenerator {
    @Override
    protected void fetchData() {
        System.out.println("Fetching data for CSV report...");
    }

    @Override
    protected void processData() {
        System.out.println("Processing data for CSV report...");
    }

    @Override
    protected void formatReport() {
        System.out.println("Formatting report as a CSV file.");
    }
}
3. Client
Use the template method to generate different types of reports:

java
Copy code
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Generate PDF report
        ReportGenerator pdfReport = new PDFReportGenerator();
        System.out.println("Generating PDF Report:");
        pdfReport.generateReport();

        System.out.println();

        // Generate CSV report
        ReportGenerator csvReport = new CSVReportGenerator();
        System.out.println("Generating CSV Report:");
        csvReport.generateReport();
    }
}
Output
plaintext
Copy code
Generating PDF Report:
Fetching data for PDF report...
Processing data for PDF report...
Formatting report as a PDF document.
Saving the report to disk.

Generating CSV Report:
Fetching data for CSV report...
Processing data for CSV report...
Formatting report as a CSV file.
Saving the report to disk.
Benefits of the Template Method Pattern
Encapsulation of Common Behavior:

Centralizes shared logic, reducing duplication.
Extensibility:

Subclasses can override specific steps without altering the algorithm’s structure.
Consistency:

Enforces a consistent structure across all implementations.
Readability and Maintainability:

Simplifies understanding by separating the structure (template) from the specifics (subclasses).
Challenges
Rigid Structure:

Limits flexibility if changes to the algorithm’s flow are needed.
Subclass Explosion:

Each variation requires a new subclass, potentially increasing complexity.
Difficulty in Debugging:

Errors in the overridden methods may be harder to trace due to the predefined flow.
Real-World Applications
Report Generation Systems:

Generate various types of reports with a common structure but different formats.
Game Development:

Define game initialization and shutdown steps while allowing customization for specific games.
Web Frameworks:

Define request processing pipelines with customizable hooks for specific actions.
Database Access:

Common data access workflows with varying query implementations.
Key Takeaways
The Template Method Pattern provides a robust way to enforce a structure while allowing customization in specific areas.
Ideal for scenarios where an algorithm has a common structure but varying steps.
Promotes code reuse, readability, and maintainability but must be used judiciously to avoid rigidity and complexity.
